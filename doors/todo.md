x track and calibrate outdoors (not 50), compile a list of bad runs, iterate with Elin on fixing those (manually)
x make sure the localpreferences.toml are included in the excel files as columns, before you concatenate.
x filter out runs that have true ignore
x for distance_cm ≠ 460: exclude all runs that have dance_by = no and Spontaneous dance
x for distance_cm == 460: change the dance_by factor to yes and no, and if a run has a Spontaneous dance then dance_by is set to yes (regardless of what is was before)
* add factor `at_run` to the statistical analysis in dark


x exclude Spontaneous from Dark
x help Elin with the description of the analysis and results of the statistical tests (of Shift) and Dark
x switch b with c in "figure_dark.png"

add factor `at_run` to the statistical analysis in shift
add one figure that includes the factor `at_run` to the shift (indoors cause that's the only relevant one), and the dark
