- check to see if we filter or ignore runs that have "spontenous dance" in their comments: we do nothing with that
all the runs that have "spontaneous dance" in their comment have specified `spontaneous_end` and `spontaneous_start`. A few that have those specified do not have "spontaneous dance" in their comments.

- check the number of tracks in the figure vs the number of tracks in the runs file, specifically, indoors shift, and outdoors 50, `dance_by`: "no" or "hold" -> but "spontenous dance", where they excluded?
- in indoors dark, there are 4 factors: light, radial distance, disruption method, previous runs. but in the stats file, and therefore in the analysis, there seems to be only 3 (the `at_run` is missing)

sythesise the tesxt the best describes the anaysis of the 4 factors for dark and indoors
OR
get question list and look at it



- change turn to bearing change
- change all the time, seconds, to path length, cm

# Figures:
figure 1 (only at_run 1
    10 tracks from each treatment: lights on, lights off (dark) 

figure 2
theta as a function of path length turning left
